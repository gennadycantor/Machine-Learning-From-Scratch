Student ID: 9071897186
Faculty Members:  NIGEL BOSTON, MICHAEL FERRIS, LAWRENCE LANDWEBER, BARTON MILLER, SUSHMITA ROY, GRACE WAHBA.

Please Note1: I have had to download individial image into the directory which my source code lives. I tried downloading the whole
webpage and pulling the photos from Spyder using built-in OS, but litearlly worked once randomly and never worked again. 
Thus, I am attaching the colour images of the faculty members along with my source code, output.txt, and this file. Otherwise,
please download them at the CS website.

Please Note2: For output.txt, because there are 1800 numbers, it was impossible to fit that in each line. But, after every fourth
line, new line of numbers begin for each image.

To run: 
1) if you are running on spyder, just click Run. Preprocessing function will pull the colour images, convert them to greyscale,
normalize it, and then turn it into an array for each image.

2) if you are running on the linux terminal please type: python HOG.py
